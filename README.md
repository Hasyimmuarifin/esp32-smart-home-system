===================================
SMART HOME IoT CONTROLLER System - Arduino/ESP32 Based
===================================

📌 OVERVIEW
-----------
Smart-Home IoT Controller is an Arduino-based project designed to automate and control home appliances using:
- Manual device control (lamp, fan, etc.)
- PIR sensor for motion detection
- Voice commands via speech recognition
- Real-time monitoring UI (e.g., Serial Monitor / external dashboard)

This project demonstrates how embedded systems, IoT, and simple AI (voice recognition) can work together to make your home smarter and more responsive.

🔧 FEATURES
----------
✅ Control multiple devices like lights and fans  
✅ Detect human presence using PIR sensor  
✅ Execute voice commands to control appliances  
✅ Real-time system feedback and monitoring  
✅ Easy to extend with additional sensors or devices  

🧰 TECHNOLOGY STACK
-------------------
- Arduino Uno / Mega
- Relay Modules
- PIR Sensor
- Microphone/Speech Recognition Module (e.g., Elechouse V3, or via mobile app)
- MQTT (optional for networking)
- Serial Communication or IoT Dashboard (e.g., Blynk, Thingspeak)

📂 FILE STRUCTURE
-----------------
- `main.ino`          → Main Arduino sketch with all integrated features  
- `README.txt`        → Project introduction and documentation   

🚀 GETTING STARTED
------------------
1. Upload the Arduino code from `main.ino` to your board
2. Connect your relays, PIR sensor, and microphone module according to the schematic
3. Open Serial Monitor or connect to your IoT dashboard
4. Try controlling devices manually or by using your voice!

💡 TIP:
-------
Test each feature (e.g., PIR, relay control, voice input) independently before integrating them together to simplify debugging.
